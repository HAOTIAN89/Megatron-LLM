The pain was constant and she valued it 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10), with a score of 10 being the most severe pain. The patient was in the middle of her menstrual cycle and she wasn't using contraceptives. She reported previous dysmenorrhea, painful intercourse, and Chlamydia infection ten years before. One year ago, she was admitted to the surgical department for renal colic. During the hospitalization, the patient had a CT scan and a right adnexal cystic mass was found. Three days before the current admission, the patient suddenly presented severe pain in the right lower quadrant, with no radiation and associated with one-day-old vomiting. She went for medical assistance to the emergency room, where she received medical treatment for suspected renal colic and urine infection. The next day, the patient complained of persistent lower abdominal pain and she presented at the emergency room again.\\\\nThe physical examination revealed an acute patient, afebrile and painful in the right lower quadrant. The pelvic examination revealed right ovarian tenderness with no cervical motion tenderness.\\\\nThe patient had a normal complete blood count and urinalysis. The CRP was 47. The urinary pregnancy test was negative. The endocervical swabs were negative.\\\\nIn the sonography examination, we found a normal uterus and a normal left ovary. A normal endometrium was also described. There was a small amount of simple free fluid in the Douglas pouch. A cystic mass was observed measuring 8 * 4 * 3.5 cm that was thought to arise from the right adnexa or the ovary.

The suspicion of torsion was high, so we performed an appendectomy and a right salpingectomy. Macroscopically, we found a paratubal cyst on the right side and a normal ovary. On the microscopic examination, endosalpingiosis was found with no evidence of malignancy ().\\\\nThe postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day.

I have been having severe pain in my lower abdomen for the past few days.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me?\\nPatient: It's a constant pain and it's pretty severe. I would rate it an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.\\nDoctor: Does the pain radiate anywhere else?\\nPatient: No, it doesn't.\\nDoctor: Have you had any other symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?\\nPatient: No, I haven't.\\n \\n\\n \\nNow, generate the corresponding clinical note.\\nA 38-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and a surgical history of a cesarean section 4 years ago, presented to the emergency department with severe constant pain in the suprapubic region. The pain started 2 days ago and has been constant since then. The patient rated the pain as 8 out of 10 in severity and reported no radiation of the pain. She denied any associated symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. She also denied any trauma, falls, or any type of injury. She reports that she is usually very healthy and goes hiking and camping in the woods often. She denies any sexually transmitted disease or promiscuity.\\nOn physical examination, the patient was a well-nourished Caucasian female who appeared to be in moderate distress from the pain. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature 37 °C, blood pressure 112/67 mmHg, pulse 87 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination was remarkable for tenderness to palpation over the suprapubic region, without rebound tenderness, peritoneal signs, or hepatosplenomegaly. The patient also underwent a pelvic examination, which was unremarkable and did not show any indication of peritonitis. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable and did not show any indication of systemic infection or inflammation.\\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids and opioids for severe pain. She was also started on ceftriaxone, as she was suspected of having an appendicitis or another intra-abdominal infection. She underwent an ultrasound of the abdomen, which showed a normal appendix and no signs of fluid collection or cholecystitis. Later on, she underwent an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan\""

He was admitted to an integrative ward of a University Hospital, with a progressing two-vessel coronary heart disease. The patient was scheduled for bypass surgery. The medical history of the patient comprised a Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and a stent implantation had been conducted in the past.\\\\nIn a short interview preceding the LAVA assessment the patient reported that he had noticed a worsening of his coronary disease under physical exertion in his daily life before hospitalization. Nevertheless, the extent of deterioration that was diagnosed during his hospitalization, surprised him and he described an uncertainty because he did not know what might have caused the worsening of his disease nor how to positively influence the progression of the disease (e.g., life style modifications).\\\\nFigure shows the LAVA self-assessment of the patient.\\\\nWhen using the LAVA-Tool the patient rated eight terms as very important for his life. The three topics the patient was most dissatisfied with were mobility, contact to nature, and the ability to make decisions independently. The negative rating of mobility and contact with nature were probably influenced by the patient\\u2019s current situation in the hospital and by his disease. However, his dissatisfaction with his ability to make decisions independently could be attributed to his lack of knowledge concerning his disease and the expected improvement of his condition and mobility after the bypass surgery. A patient consultation that focused on a shared decision and understanding of the link between the treatment aims and his current negative experiences in life could therefore be helpful.\\\\nFor this patient, the application of the LAVA tool led to the conclusion that the patient had a need for information. In this case, more information about the disease and the planned surgical intervention could probably help the patient to reduce his uncertainty and to feel more empowered to actively participate in his treatment. In the preceding interview the importance of the information need was not fully captured by the interviewer. The LAVA tool \\u2013 forcing the patient to weigh his satisfaction with important aspects in his life \\u2013 made it easier to capture his priorities, thereby showing a potential to improve his situation with a simple measure (i.e. patient information). One could argue that more information and a better understanding of the planned intervention would not have changed the somatic state of the patient. However, and most importantly, for patients with multiple conditions an improvement in well-being and a reduction of fear and uncertainty could make an important difference to their quality of life.\"}'''\n",

The first episode occurred at the age of 22 months following a respiratory tract infection. At that time, her creatine kinase (CK) serum concentration was noted to be 250 000 U\\/L.\\\\nThe family history indicated that both parents were well. However, two siblings (brother and sister) had sudden death at the age of 2 and 4 years more than 20 years ago following a short infectious illness with sudden deterioration over a period of hours. In both cases, the children became progressively weak with severe muscle pain and had evidence of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria of uncertain etiology. Skeletal muscle histology and electron microscopy studies at postmortem evaluation were normal in both children, cardiac evaluation demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. Notes pertaining to their clinical episodes were not available. On first presentation, our patient had no hypoglycemia and no ketosis during the acute illness, but was initially treated as a possible long chain fatty acid oxidation defect due to the family history.\\\\nThe patient had numerous subsequent admissions with similar presentations of extremely elevated CK concentration (1 000 000 U\\/L at the age of 9) associated with muscle pain. This was despite aggressive carbohydrate supplementation including nocturnal cornstarch. Her fat intake from food was continually restricted to approximately 40 g\\/d. Her total fat intake was supplemented with the use of MCT Oil (medium chain triglycerides supplement) and essential fatty acids in the form of walnut oil. Coenzyme Q10 at a dose of 100-200 mg daily was provided on an ongoing basis. The CK concentration was also raised between the episodes (500-2000 U\\/L). She was advised to limit her exercise to 20 minutes per day and have high-calorie drink prior to any physical activity.\\\\nExtensive investigations were performed over the presenting years with the lack of a definite etiology. Serial urine organic acid profile and the acylcarnitine profiles were normal. A fibroblast fatty acid oxidation study showed normal myristate and palmitate oxidation studies in fibroblasts. Genetic analysis for fatty acid oxidation defect (LCHAD, MCAD, CPT I, and CPT II) and McArdle disease was uninformative.\\\\nAt the age of 16 years, mitochondrial respiratory chain activity measured in a muscle biopsy was normal, however morphological findings, such as intramyocellular lipid, were compatible with lipin-1 deficiency (Figure ). Her echocardiogram and electrocardiogram did not show any abnormal findings.\\\\nAt the age of 19 years, DNA sequence analysis of the LPIN1 gene (all coding exons and flanking intron boundaries corresponding to the canonical transcript variant NM_145693.3) revealed the presence of a common pathogenic intragenic deletion within the LPIN1 gene (c.2295-866_2410-30del1763) encompassing exon 18 (HGMD accession: CG085181). However, a second mutation could not be identified.\\\\nSubsequently, the LPIN1 coding region was analyzed by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) from total RNA isolated from muscle tissue and conventional DNA sequencing (Figure A,B). In addition to transcripts lacking exon 18 or exons 18-19 (corresponding to the allele harboring the genomic exon 18 deletion), an alternative exon spliced in between exon 5 and exon 6 was detected in a significant proportion of transcripts (Figure C,D). Because this alternative exon, named exon 5a, corresponded to an alternatively spliced in-frame exon annotated only in an N-terminal LPIN1 transcript variant (NM_001261428.2), further targeted DNA-based sequencing was performed. Indeed, this identified a second heterozygous variant (NC_000002.11:g.11916284C>A), which was formally regarded a nonsense mutation introducing a premature stop-codon within exon 5a (which would correspond to NM_001261428.2:c.942C>A, NP_001248357.1:p.[Cys314*]; Figure ). RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from healthy skeletal muscle detected exon 5a also in transcripts containing the first (noncoding) exon of the canonical isoform (data not shown). However, because exon 5a is currently not annotated to be contained in this main reference transcript (NM_145693.3), further studies will be needed to clearly establish pathogenicity of the novel variant.\\\\nSegregation analysis in the patient's family revealed that her father and younger sister are heterozygous for the common pathogenic intragenic deletion (NM_145693.3:c.2295-866_2410-30del1763), while her mother was a heterozygous carrier of the variant within the alternative exon. Thus, the results of these molecular genetic analyses were formally consistent with the clinical diagnosis of LPIN1-associated rhabdomyolysis, due to compound heterozygosity for a known pathogenic deletion and potentially pathogenic novel mutation.\\\\nAt the age of 25 years, the patient presented with acute muscle pain and weakness following prolonged fasting and strenuous exercise. A rhabdomyolysis crisis was confirmed with a CK of 500 000 U\\/L. She was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for a 2 week period over which period she lost a significant amount of weight. During her critical illness, she received an intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose at 1.5 times maintenance with added electrolytes, sodium bicarbonate, morphine, and dexamethasone. Intravenous carnitine was also provided as the patient had previously observed this to be clinically beneficial. She was treated symptomatically, with shortened fasting periods, corn-starch at night and an \\u201cunwell dietary regimes\\u201d with a mild restriction of fat (40 g per day) and supplementation with MCT oil and walnut oil for essential fatty acids and Liquigen 5 g daily. On day 11, her CK was monitored 4 hourly and was 1248 U\\/L. On discharge from ICU, this patient had generalized muscle weakness, stiff lower limb muscles (gastrocnemius), and bilateral drop foot requiring orthotic splints. Muscle weakness gradually improved after months of rehabilitative physiotherapy. Her drop foot has improved somewhat (power from 0\\/5 to 3\\/5 for dorsiflexion and extensor hallicis longus over 1 year) with areas of altered sensation anterolaterally below the knees consistent with bilateral residual common peroneal neuropathies (CPN). Serial nerve conduction\\/electromyography studies demonstrated bilateral CPN palsies and a background generalized myopathy. The most likely cause of this patient's weakness was a critical care neuromyopathy, which has improved with time, in addition to CPN palsies related to significant weight loss while critically ill. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that both defects were related to her lipin-1 deficiency. While myopathy has been reported in a few cases, CPN damage is not a known association of this rare metabolic disorder.\"}'''\n",
